[Rosalind](https://rosalind.info/problems/locations/) is an educational resource and web project for learning bioinformatics through problem solving and computer programming.Rosalind users learn bioinformatics concepts through a problem tree that builds up biological, algorithmic, and programming knowledge concurrently or learn by topics, with the topic of `Alignment`, `Combinatorics`, `Computational Mass Spectrometry`, `Heredity`, `Population Dynamics` and so on. Each problem is checked automatically, allowing for the project to also be used for automated homework testing in existing classes.

* Python Village

  If you are completely new to programming, try these initial problems to learn a few basics about the Python programming language. You'll get familiar with the operations needed to start solving bioinformatics challenges in the Stronghold.

* Bioinformatics Stronghold

  Discover the algorithms underlying a variety of bioinformatics topics: computational mass spectrometry, alignment, dynamic programming, genome assembly, genome rearrangements, phylogeny, probability, string algorithms and others.

* Bioinformatics Armory

  Ready-to-use software tools abound for bioinformatics analysis. Whereas in the Stronghold you implement algorithms on your own, in the Armory you solve similar problems by using existing tools.

* Bioinformatics Textbook Track

  A collection of exercises to accompany Bioinformatics Algorithms: An Active-Learning Approach by Phillip Compeau & Pavel Pevzner. A full version of this text is hosted on stepic.org

* Algorithmic Heights

  A collection of exercises in introductory algorithms to accompany "Algorithms", the popular textbook by Dasgupta, Papadimitriou, and Vazirani.
